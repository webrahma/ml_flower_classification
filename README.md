# Iris Flower Classification (Binary) 🌸

A Machine Learning project to classify Iris flowers into two species (**Setosa** and **Versicolor**) using supervised learning algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I performed binary classification by filtering the classic Iris dataset. The goal was to compare the performance of different models and build a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Models Compared
I implemented and compared two main algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier:** A non-linear model that uses a tree-like structure for decision-making.

### Key Insights:
* High correlation observed between **Petal Width** and the target class.
* Performance evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

## 📊 Evaluation
To understand the models better, I used a **Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)** to visualize True Positives and False Positives.



## 🖥️ Graphical User Interface (GUI)
I built a desktop application using **Tkinter** that allows users to:
* Input Sepal/Petal measurements.
* Get instant predictions from both models simultaneously.
* See alerts if the models disagree on the classification.
