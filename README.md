# Iris Flower Classification (Binary) 🌸

A Machine Learning project to classify Iris flowers into two species (**Setosa** and **Versicolor**) using supervised learning algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I performed binary classification by filtering the classic Iris dataset. The goal was to compare the performance of different models and build a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Models Compared
I implemented and compared two main algorithms:
1. **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier:** A non-linear model that uses a tree-like structure for decision-making.

### Key Insights:
* High correlation observed between **Petal Width** and the target class.
* Performance evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

## 📊 Evaluation
To understand the models better, I used a **Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)** to visualize True Positives and False Positives.

🖥️ Interactive GUI inside Jupyter Notebook
This project includes a built-in Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with Tkinter. Unlike traditional scripts, the interface is integrated directly into the notebook for an interactive experience.

How to run the GUI:
Open the flower_classification.ipynb file.

Run all the code cells in sequence.

The prediction window will automatically pop up after the last cell is executed.
